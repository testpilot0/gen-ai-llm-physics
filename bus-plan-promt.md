# Step 1: Define Your Vision
help me to create a vision statement for new start-up building new technology described in this abstract: " a new type of ultrasound-based brain-computer interface (BCI). I believe that this approach has the potential to make BCIs more accessible to a wider range of people and I would be honored to discuss it with your experts at Google Research or Neuralink.

We are working on a new type of BCI which is based on a recently published novel approach used by Japanese researchers to reconstruct human mental images based on fMRI. In their approach, this team uses fMRI technology to collect brain activity data during visual perception and during imaging some mental pictures. This data is used to train a machine learning model that can then reconstruct an arbitrary mental picture which a person can imagine.

We are proposing to complement this approach with external ultrasound transcranial stimulation of those brain voxels which have been active during imaginary tasks. Using ultrasound stimulation, we expect to induce a perception of imaginative pictures, thus creating a sort of "mental visual telepathy."

We are exploring and combining those two technologies:

One that leverages fMRI technology to perform "High-resolution image reconstruction with latent diffusion models from human brain activity" - https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2022.11.18.517004v1
Another technology that was developed for ultrasound-based drug delivery.
We are modifying this method to trigger activation of certain locations in the brain to induce mental imagery. Basically, we are proposing technology to induce the experience of sensory information without a direct external stimulus.

The method we are developing uses low doses of some precursors for neurotransmitters that the subject can take orally. Those precursors can metabolize to neurotransmitters and pass the blood-brain barrier. They will be distributed across the brain with almost no effect as suggested doses are small. But then we propose to use external ultrasound stimulation focused to certain locations in the brain to trigger enhanced absorption of those neurotransmitters in those areas of interest.

This enhanced absorption increases the concentration of neurotransmitters in selected areas and as a result triggers neuron activity.

We have performed a few personal experiments using low-intensity ultrasound emitters and low doses of galantamine, 5-HTP (precursor of serotonin neurotransmitter), and a few other neurotransmitter precursors which are freely available in supplement stores. As a preliminary result, we can report some subjective evidence that the method works and triggers certain parts of my brain which I can detect with portable BCI devices like OpenBCI and Neurosity.

We believe that this new approach has the potential to overcome some of the limitations of current BCI technologies. For example, it could be used to create BCIs that are less invasive and more accessible to a wider range of people. Our project targets three primary user categories, each with unique and valuable applications:

A. Gamers: We aim to enhance the gaming experience by enabling users to trigger mental images directly in their brains, creating immersive and dynamic gameplay.

B. Individuals with Disabilities: People with conditions such as cerebral palsy or visual impairments can benefit from our technology. We plan to develop brain-computer interfaces that can induce mental images, providing new means of communication and sensory experiences for this community.

C. Lucid Dreaming and Secure Communication Enthusiasts: We recognize the interest in lucid dreaming and secure communication. Our technology can empower individuals to control their dreams and securely transmit specific mental images to recipients' brains.

It's important to emphasize that we do not intend to position this technology for medical use; rather, our focus is on consumer applications."

# Step 6: Financial Projections

help me estimate my revenue for the first year of a new serice based on for technology described in this abstract "Our project centers on the development of an ultrasound-based brain-computer interface, a technology that has the potential to democratize access to BCIs and revolutionize the way we interface with the human mind. This innovation builds upon a recent breakthrough by Japanese researchers in the reconstruction of human mental images using functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI). Their methodology, which leverages fMRI data and machine learning, enables the reconstruction of mental images based solely on an individual's thoughts.

Our proposal takes this achievement a step further by introducing external ultrasound transcranial stimulation. By targeting the specific brain voxels activated during mental imagery tasks, we aim to induce the perception of imaginative pictures—a concept we term "mental visual telepathy." We believe that this integration of ultrasound stimulation with fMRI-derived data has the potential to unlock new realms of cognitive technology and human-computer interaction.

Technological Integration:

Our project bridges two distinct technologies:

fMRI-Based Image Reconstruction: We leverage the state-of-the-art "High-resolution image reconstruction with latent diffusion models from human brain activity" methodology developed by experts in the field. This allows us to translate brain activity data into vivid mental images.

Ultrasound-Based Stimulation: We adapt ultrasound-based drug delivery techniques to trigger specific brain locations and induce mental imagery. This technology aims to create sensory experiences without external stimuli.

Innovation and Impact:

Our research has yielded promising preliminary results, demonstrating the potential of our ultrasound-based approach to trigger specific regions of the brain, as detected by portable BCI devices such as OpenBCI and Neurosity. This technology has the power to overcome many limitations of current BCIs, offering less invasive solutions with profound implications for healthcare, communication, and human cognition. And that We plan to offer our technology to three main groups of customers:

Gamers: Our technology can be used to enhance the gaming experience by allowing gamers to trigger mental images directly in their brains.
People with disabilities: Our technology can help people with cerebral palsy and other disabilities by allowing them to use brain-computer interfaces to interact with the world around them.
People interested in induced dreams: Our technology can be used to induce lucid dreams and to control the content of dreams."
